    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For our second Web Development Immersive project at GA, we were tasked with working with a group of fellow students to build a web app. The first challenge we faced was coming up with an idea. In preparation for that, we decided, as a group, to utilize <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking">design thinking</a> to brainstorm project ideas, and then refine those ideas into something that we would all be proud of at the end of the 8 days allotted to building the app.</p>

<p>The final idea was to build a social party app, which we later called <a href="http://leder-feier.herokuapp.com">Lederfeier</a> that provided fun prompts to people to spark real-life conversations. While seemingly ironic, we wanted to use smart phones to help people put down their smart phones and have a real conversation! The features were simple: a party planner would be able to create a party, select a prompt rating, and invite participants by entering their phone numbers. Participants could also join by texting a passphrase to a dedicated phone number. Once the party was officially started, all participants would receive a conversation prompt via text message, that they could pass or complete. See below for some prompt examples.</p>

<h4>Prompt Examples:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Almonds. Discuss.</li>
<li>If you could make something that&rsquo;s not socially acceptable, acceptable. What would it be?</li>
<li>Describe the best meal you&rsquo;ve ever had</li>
<li>Describe the characteristics of a perfect pair of socks</li>
</ul>


<p>Working in a group project was exciting as it allowed each of us to focus on certain parts of the project while learning from eachother&rsquo;s expertise. I&rsquo;ve included some thoughts on core aspects of the project below.</p>

<h4>TDD:</h4>

<p>To distribute text messages, we used Twilio. The integration was seamless and honestly a charm to put together. However, we quickly realized that testing all the potential participant responses and edge cases via a phone keyboard would be not only expensive (Twilio credits cost money), but VERY time consuming. Fortunately, we made the decision to leverage TDD to test all of the Twilio messages and responses. This decision turned out to be an incredible time saver, and it allowed us to confidently make changes to the app without fear of breaking things.</p>

<h4>Mobile-First and AJAX requests:</h4>

<p>To ensure that the user experience was easy to use from a smart phone, we spent a lot of time working on the UI and user flow. We made an effort to minimize user interaction by using ajax requests to refresh page data on a set interval. We also made the buttons big enough to click on from a mobile browser, and only rendered buttons when necessary using jQuery selectors.</p>

<h4>Github: (<a href="https://github.com/sarlaf/bedazzledbaldachin">Lederfeier Repo</a>)</h4>

<p>As familiar as we had become with Github during WDI for personal projects, working with Github in a multi-user team presented a new set of challenges. Following best practices, we created a central repo and each team member forked that repo to make changes. Once those changes were ready, a pull request was made and another team member reviewed and accepted the pull request. We quickly learned to rebase off the master on our local forks before sending the pull request to avoid serious version control issues!</p>

    <id>http://francisco.github.io/blog/2013/12/03/refinery-gem-content-management-in-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my previous life I was a marketer and website manager. It&rsquo;s safe to say I spent A LOT of time building and updating site content in many different content management systems. Wordpress, Typepad, Drupal, Joomla and others all became good friends of mine, some more than others. Wordpress was always my favorite for many reasons. It&rsquo;s relatively easy to manage and update content, even for non-technical people. There’s a huge community of designers and developers who build templates for Wordpress implementations, not to mention countless plugins that make integrations fairly easy &ndash; although admittedly I’ve had plenty of problems with those WP plugins.</p>

<p>As a newly minted developer however, my perception of a CMS has changed significantly. While Wordpress may be great for static content sites with minimal functionality, Wordpress can quickly reach its limitations when it’s asked to manage large data sets or perform complex functions.</p>

<p>It was for these reasons that I was excited to learn about the open source <a href="http://refinerycms.com/">Refinery CMS gem for Ruby on Rails</a>. The platform incorporates the front-end ease of use of Wordpress with the powerful MVC backend of Rails, all bundled up (yes, I’m going there) in a developer friendly gem. In my opinion this makes for a winning combination. There is also a large community supporting Refinery which makes integrations a snap. In fact, here’s a list of some of the <a href="http://refinerycms.com/engines">Refinery engines</a>. And of course there’s the ability to scale a rails app quickly and efficiently, including data integrations, account management, secure payment processing and much more.</p>

<p>A quick google search on Refinery will also brought up a long list of favorable reviews <a href="http://blog.flatironschool.com/post/54511602806/build-a-blog-based-site-with-refinerycms">(here’s one of many)</a> about Refinery. Other developers who have implemented the Refinery Content Management System claim that it’s fast, reliable and scalable, all wrapped in a easy to use novice-friendly UI. Did I also mention that Refinery is a completely open source project?</p>

<p>All in all, <a href="http://refinerycms.com/">Refinery</a> is definitely a gem that I’ll consider the next time a CMS type project comes along. If you’re interested, go check out Refinery CMS for yourself.</p>

    <id>http://francisco.github.io/blog/2013/11/10/learncode-my-first-project-as-a-web-developer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With four weeks of GA’s Web Development Immersive under my belt, it came time to embark on my first official Rails project. I knew I wanted to build something that leveraged a publicly accessible API and a map. Fortunately, I stumbled upon <a href="http://code.org">Code.org</a> and their awesome Local School Database API. After some brainstorming, I wanted <a href="http://learncode.herokuapp.com">Learncode</a> to achieve the following:
&ndash; Inspire visitors to learn to code
&ndash; Help those visitors find relevant self-study information
&ndash; Display all the physical schools where one could learn to code</p>

<p>For my MVP, I focused on implementing the following features:
&ndash; Access Code.org&rsquo;s Local Schools Database
&ndash; Install Leaflet maps
&ndash; Add map markers using address-to-Lat/Long conversion with Google Maps
&ndash; Embed school data in a map marker popup
&ndash; Add search-by-address functionality to move the map to the entered address
&ndash; Create an aesthetically pleasing UI</p>

<p>I was able to move quickly with implementing many of the MVP features, but encountered a few challenges that required some creative problem solving and help from my instructors to overcome.</p>

<h3>Challenge 1:</h3>

<p>The Local Schools Database was temporarily down meaning I could not access the JSON schools data with a simple Ajax request.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Developed a Nokogiri rake task to scrape a data sample for a handful of cities as a proof of concept for the MVP. With the sample data in my database, I developed a second rake task to convert each school&rsquo;s address to lat/long and stored that in the Database. I later implemented the Rails Geocoder Gem for this.</p>

<h3>Challenge 2:</h3>

<p>Render the map-markers using Javascript to avoid routing the user to a new view after each search.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Implemented an Ajax request to pull in the markers from the Database and render them on the page. To do so, I created an API using a respond_to query in my Rails controller. I’ve included the ruby code snippet below.</p>

<p><strong>Ruby on Rails Controller Index Function:</strong></p>

<pre><code>#Select all offline schools from Database and assign to variable
offline_schools = OfflineSchool.all

#API to render data accesible via an AJAX request
respond_to do |format|
  format.html
  format.json {
    lat = params[:lat]
    lng = params[:lng]
    render json: OfflineSchool.near([lat, lng], 50, :order =&gt; :distance)
  }
end
</code></pre>

<p>After the MVP was complete, I spent time improving the front-end, while implementing a few more controllers and views with relevant content to inspire users to learn code and help them find self-study resources.</p>

<p>Looking back, building my first real website from scratch was an incredibly rewarding experience. I challenged myself to learn new things while leveraging everything I had learned in the previous 4 weeks at General Assembly. But more importantly, I achieved a major life goal of mine (to build a web app on my own) and sparked what I know will be a life-long passion for web development.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a link to my <a href="http://learncode.herokuapp.com">Heroku deploy</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/francisco/codemapsalpha">Github Repo</a>. I&rsquo;ve also included some screenshots of Learncode. I plan to soon release some updates to resolve some of the JavaScript and CSS bugs.</p>
